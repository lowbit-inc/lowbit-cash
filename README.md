## Ideas

- Accounts should have type
- "Income by source/type" Report
- "Expenses by source/type" Report
- "Budget" Report
- Tool to help creating a balanced budget on envelopes
  - For example, first deciding on percentages (as in the 50/30/20 method)
- Must have a budget also for Incomes
- Must have a way to storing the projected Income by Month
